# Data Structures and Schemas in Gemini Function Calling

### Overview

Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for multimodal use cases. The Gemini API gives you access to the Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash and Gemini Pro Vision models.

Function Calling in Gemini lets you create a description of a function in your code, then pass that description to a language model in a request. The response from the model includes the name of a function that matches the description and the arguments to call it with.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to work with various data structures within Gemini Function Calling, including:

- Single parameter
- Multiple parameters
- Lists of parameters
- Nested parameters and data structures
