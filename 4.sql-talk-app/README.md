# SQLite Database Interaction with the Gemini API & Javascript SDK

### Overview

#### Gemini
Gemini is a powerful suite of generative AI models by Google DeepMind, tailored for multimodal applications. It enables developers to integrate advanced AI capabilities into their applications seamlessly.

#### Function Calling with Gemini
Function Calling in Gemini revolutionizes how developers interact with generative AI models. It allows for the definition of functions within code, which can then be communicated to the model. The model responds with the appropriate function name and arguments, facilitating a structured and predictable interaction pattern.

#### The Power of Function Calling
Traditionally, extracting structured information from generative models has been challenging due to their propensity for unstructured output. Function Calling addresses this by enabling structured data exchange, defined by the developer, between the application and the AI model. This structured interaction paves the way for more reliable and efficient AI-driven functionalities within applications.

#### Objectives
This tutorial guides you through leveraging the Gemini API and the Generative AI SDK for Javascript to interact with an SQLite database. By integrating these technologies, you can perform complex database operations based on natural language prompts.

You will learn to utilize the Generative AI SDK with the Gemini API to:
  - Retrieve table names from an SQLite database.
  - Count rows within a specific table.
  - Fetch the schema of a table.
  - Execute custom SQL queries based on user prompts.

### Getting Started

1. **Prepare the database:**
    ```sh
    # Create the database schema
    npm run start:sql:ddl

    # Generate some seed data
    npm run start:sql:seed
    ```
1. **Interacting with SQLite:**
  The provided `index.ts` script showcases how to integrate function calling with database operations. It includes functions for listing tables, counting rows, retrieving table schemas, and executing queries based on natural language inputs.
1. **Execute the app**
    ```sh
    # Execute the sql-talk-app example
    npm run start:sql
    ```

### Conclusion

By integrating the Gemini API with the Generative AI SDK for Javascript, developers can create more intuitive and interactive applications. This tutorial provides a foundation for using these technologies to interact with SQLite databases, demonstrating the potential for AI-enhanced database management and operations.
